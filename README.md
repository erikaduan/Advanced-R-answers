# Advanced R notes  

This repository contains personal/copied notes and personal exercise answers made whilst completing [Advanced R - 2nd edition](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.  

I recommend reading [Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/) by Malte Grosser, Henning Bumann & Hadley Wickham for in-depth solutions to the exercises found in [Advanced R - 2nd edition](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). My notes only exist because the best way for me to learn something is to actually write it down.
