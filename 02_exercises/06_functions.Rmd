# Chapter goals   

Understanding how **functions** operate helps you to:  

+ Understand the basic three components of a function.  
+ Understand the differences behind a primitive function.  
+ Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of function composition in R. 
+ Understand how R finds the value associated within a given name locally inside a function.  
+ Understand how arguments, including the special argument `...`, operate.       
+ Understand the two ways that a function can exit.       
+ Understand the ways in which R disguises ordinary function calls.
