# Chapter goals     

Understanding the properties and behaviours of vectors helps you to:    

+ Understand the difference between atomic vectors and lists.  
+ Understand how different object types (i.e. factors, dates, matrixes, data frames) are created from vectors.     


# Vector types    

There are techincally three different types of vectors:   

+ Atomic vector - all elements must contain the same element type.     
+ List - elements do not need to contain the same element type.     
+ `NULL` - can be viewed as a generic vector of zero length.    

Vectors have attributes, which is a list of metadata. The dimension attribute turns vectors into matrices and arrays and the class attribute powers the S3 object system (i.e. factors, date and times, data frames, and tibbles).     


## Atomic vectors    

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.show = 'hold', out.width = '60%'}  
# knitr::include_graphics("../01_figures/03_vectors-1.jpg")  
```
