# Aim

Understanding the distinction between an **object** and its **name**
helps you to:

  - Better predict the performance and memory usage of your code.  
  - Write faster code by avoiding accidental copies, a major source of
    slow code.  
  - Better understand Râ€™s functional programming tools.

**In R, it is the name that has a value bound to it.**

  object
} 

e <- object_funs(object = a)

# (a) is a name that is assigned to a specific object [object 1:10]
# (a) and (b) are both names that point to the same object in memory
# (c) is a name that points to the name (b) - therefore (c) should point to what (a) and (b) are point to
# (d) is a value that is pointing to a new object [object 1:10]

``` r
# Whenever you modify an object that has a name assigned to it, 
# you are not actually modifying the object itself,
# but creating a new object and re-binding your name to the new object.
